# SevenWonders

Seven wonders is third project in ABND course:
The goal was to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of his/her choice.
 and how to present them to the user. I had to plan my app design before coding. My choise was to choose the topic for the quizzes
I had vto take my app layout from drawing to XML code.
I had to Create, position, and style views.
Had to create interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
I had to comment and document my code.
First, build the layout. This involves creating the quiz questions, deciding what type of quiz they will be, and formatting them in the xml layout file for your Activity.

Second, you'll want to write code that links the layout to the activity. For step 3, you'll want variables that refer to each of the quiz answers.

Finally, write the code for the button which checks your answers. This code should run through each question in the app, record whether the user got the question right, and then display the quiz results in a Toast message.

##Project overview:
- My app contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.
- Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
- Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers. Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right answer.
- App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.
- The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup.
- The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated.
